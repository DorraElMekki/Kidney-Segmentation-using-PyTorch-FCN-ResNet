# Kidney-Segmentation-using-PyTorch-FCN-ResNet
The kidney is a structurally complex organ essential for human survival. It is composed of 8 to 18 pyramid-shaped lobes. Each of them consists of an outer renal cortex and an inner renal medulla. Between these sections are the nephrons.  Kidney pathologies can be categorized based on the affected segment of the nephron: the glomerulus, the tubules, the interstitium, or the blood supply. Among these nephron components, we will focus on the glomerulus, a microscopic filter of blood. In this context, we aim to identify glomeruli in Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) stained microscopy data by means of segmentation algorithms.
